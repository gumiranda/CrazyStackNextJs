# Page Structure

- Create new pages at: `app/PAGE_NAME/page.tsx`
- Components for the page are either put in the `app/PAGE_NAME/components` folder
- Pages are Server components so you can load data into them directly
- If we're in a deeply nested component we will use `@tanstack/react-query` to fetch via API
- If you need to use `onClick` in a component, that component is a client component and file must start with `use client`
